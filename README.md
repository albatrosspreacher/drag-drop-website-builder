### Problem Statement:

Nowadays, most companies rely on websites for authenticity and to reach a wider audience. Building a good website however, requires extensive sense of aesthetic and knowledge of programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JS.
As a consequence, this process could be <span style="color:blue">time consuming</span> and <span style="color:blue">expensive.</span> While websites like Wix, and Webflow exist, theyâ€™re <span style="color:blue">expensive</span> and often <span style="color:blue">tough to use.</span>

### Proposed Solution:

Instead of hiring a web developer to build and manage your website, use our <span style="color:blue">drag and drop website builder</span> to streamline the process. Just drag the elements of your choice or modify our existing templates to build a website for your brand within minutes. Customise the background, colours, text fonts, and much more.

HTMLâ€™s Drag and Drop API and Bootstrapâ€™s styled buttons, forms, and navigation bars are used. GitHub is used to collaborate on the project. Flask, which is based in Python, is used as the web development framework. The website will be hosted on glitch.com.

The project itself will be <span style="color:blue">open source</span> and will be <span style="color:blue">available for use.</span>

### Technologies Used:

- UI/UX: Adobe Xd
- Front End: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (CSS Library)
- Back End: JS
- Web Developement Framework: Express JS
- DevOps: Github
- Web Hosting: [glitch.com](www.glitch.com)
